# Global-Warming-Forecast
Summary of the Study on Machine Learning Applications in Climate Prediction

Abstract
This research investigates the use of Support Vector Regression (SVR) combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to predict global warming trends, utilizing extensive climate datasets.

Introduction
Leveraging machine learning advancements, the study builds on previous research, notably Harvey Zheng's work with random forests, to analyze the impacts of climate change using a diverse range of environmental data.

Methodology
The methodology involves SVR analysis enhanced by PCA for dimensionality reduction, applied across various climate datasets. The study details data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training processes.

Results
The results indicate that the SVR model's effectiveness varies across continents, with performance disparities likely due to data variability and measurement inconsistencies. These findings are presented through metrics such as Mean Squared Error and R-squared values.

Conclusion
While the study demonstrates the potential of machine learning in climate predictions, it also highlights the complexity of climate data and the need for more sophisticated modeling approaches. Future research could expand the dataset, incorporate diverse climate indicators, and explore different machine learning algorithms to improve predictive accuracy. This study provides a foundation for further integrating machine learning in climate change research, essential for informed policy-making and mitigation strategies.
